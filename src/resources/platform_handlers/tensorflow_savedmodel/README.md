# Serving Tensorflow SavedModels using Python Backend \[Experimental\]

*NOTE*: This feature is subject to change and removal, and should not
be used in production.

Starting from 23.07, we are adding experimental support for loading
and serving of models in [TensorFlow SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model)
format via Python backend. The `model.savedmodel` can be provided within
the triton server model repository without `model.py` and backend will
automatically use a pre-built python model (`model.py`)[model.py] to load
and serve provided TF SavedModel. The handler can [auto-complete](../../../../README.md#auto_complete_config)
the missing model configuration.

The model repository structure can look like:

```
model_repository/
`-- resnet_v1_50_savedmodel
    |-- 1
    |   `-- model.savedmodel
    |       |-- saved_model.pb
    |       `-- variables
    |-- config.pbtxt
    `-- resnet50_labels.txt
```

In order to use this feature, make sure that [TensorFlow pip package](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/2.13.0/)
is available in the same Python environment.

```
pip install tensorfow==2.13.0
```

Alternatively, you can create a
[Python Execution Environment](#using-custom-python-execution-environments)
with the TensorFlow dependency.

By default, Triton will use the [TensorFlow backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorflow_backend)
to load and serve the saved model. In order to use the Python backend with
TensorFlow SavedModel, [model configuration](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md)
should explicitly provide the following settings:

```
backend: "python"
platform: "tensorflow_savedmodel"
```

It has been observed that certain DLFW like TensorFlow do not release the entire
memory allocated for loading a model back to the system when the model gets
unloaded. This can be problematic when working with a large number of models and
dynamically loading/unloading them. Using Python backend for TF SavedModel serving
will allow the models to be loaded in a separate process, which ensures that entire
memory allocated within the process would be released to the system upon a model
unload.

Following are few known limitations of this feature:
- GPU execution is not supported.
- List of requests received in model [`execute`](../../../../README.md#execute) function are
not run in a single batch but one after the other.
