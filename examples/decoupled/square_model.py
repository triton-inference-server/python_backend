    that is created must have "TritonPythonModel" as the class name.

    This model demonstrates how to write a decoupled model where each
    request can generate 0 to many responses.

    This model has one input and one output. The model can support batching,
    with constraint that each request must be batch-1 request, but the shapes
    described here refer to the non-batch portion of the shape.

      - Input 'IN' must have shape [1] and datatype INT32.
      - Output 'OUT' must have shape [1] and datatype INT32.

    For a request, the backend will sent 'n' responses where 'n' is the
    element in IN. For each response, OUT will equal the element of IN.
